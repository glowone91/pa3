// class R{
//     String any;
//     R field;

//     R(String any, R field) { 
//     this.any = any;

// 1. I wasn't able to construct an example R object. 
// I'm not sure if this is because I wrote something wrong,
// or because R has been declared at multiple places beforehand 
// already. 

// 2. I think it would be possible, as CommentReply 
// is able to check for replies on the comments already. 
// Thus it fulfills the requirement we need to construct 
// an example of a reply to a reply to a comment.
